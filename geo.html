<div class="card active">1) Difference between intra-community and extra-community migration <br>  Intra-community migration refers to the movement of individuals within the European Union (EU), where EU citizens have the right to live and work in any member state. Extra-community migration involves individuals from non-EU countries migrating to the EU, requiring legal documentation such as visas and work permits. Source: European Commission</div>
<div class="card">2) Six aspects that migration impacts in the EU <br> Social and public services, the economy, employment, discrimination, legislation, media representation of immigrants.</div>
<div class="card">3) Negative aspects of emigration on a donor country <br> Emigration can result in significant challenges for donor countries, including labor shortages, economic instability, and demographic imbalances. The departure of skilled professionals leads to a phenomenon known as "brain drain," which refers to the large-scale emigration of educated and highly skilled individuals. Source: OECD </div>
<div class="card">4) Countries with highest emigration in 2015 <br>) In 2015 the countries with the two highest intra-eu emigration were Romania and Poland. (source: https://www.quantmig.eu/res/files/QuantMig_Deliverable%204.2%20v1.1Final.pdf) </div>
<div class="card">5) Countries with growing emigration in 2015 <br> Greece and Portugal experienced increasing emigration levels due to economic downturns.</div>
<div class="card">6) Positive impact of emigration on a donor country <br> It alleviates unemployment by reducing the labor pool, resulting in increased incomes for other workers. Many emigrants send remittances, boosting the economy of the donor country. (source: https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR244.html)</div>
<div class="card">7) Positive and negative impacts of migration on a host country <br>  Migration contributes positively to host countries by addressing labor shortages, increasing cultural diversity, and stimulating economic growth. However, it can also strain public services, create housing demand pressures, and contribute to social tensions if integration policies are inadequate. A well-managed migration policy can maximize economic benefits while minimizing social challenges. </div>
<div class="card">8) Main EU host countries for intra-community migrants in 2017 <br> The two countries that received the most EU migrants in 2017 were Germany and the UK.</div>
<div class="card">9) Country hosting the most EU employees in the past decade <br> Germany has been the leading host country for EU employees due to its strong economy, industrial sector, and employment opportunities.</div>
<div class="card">10) How much did EU citizens' annual inflows to Germany increase between 2009 and 2015? <br> 20,000 in 2010 increased to over 50,000 in 2015.</div>
<div class="card">11) How much did EU citizens annual inflows to UK increase between 2009 and 2015?<br> From 20.000 in 2010 to 30.000 in 2015</div>
<div class="card">12)Other than UK and Germany, what are the other important destination EU countries for intra and extra-community migration?  <br>Other countries that are very relevant to migration both within and from outside the EU are Spain and Italy. (source: https://www.perceptions.eu/current-migration-trends-in-and-within-europe-2/)</div>
<div class="card">13)Difference between integration, assimilation, and multiculturalism  <br>Integration allows cultural coexistence, assimilation involves adopting the dominant culture, and multiculturalism promotes diversity</div>
